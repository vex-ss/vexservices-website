[1] - Grab a creditd card using preferably a prepaid bin or a business debit bin ( Do this on a burner phone )

[2] - Go on Postmates and make an account. 

[3] - Go to add Postmates cash and you will see the option to add $25 $50 $75 or $100. Nigga if you hit anything besides $25 it will not work. 

[4] - Due to the security on Postmates being bad at the moment, you can spam $25 until your Postmates cash account looks like a damn bank account.

[5] - To cash out order a shit ton of batteries from Walgreens or CVS then sell them to eBay for a profit but be smart. If your lucky you can use BestBuy and you should already know what's up.
