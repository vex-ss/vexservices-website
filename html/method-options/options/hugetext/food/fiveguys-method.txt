[4] - I have the phone number for Brooklyn, New York if anyone is interested, you don't have to really see them one you have the number of the division manager of the place you're trying to see.

[5] - Just call and say you told me to call next time I visit and you said you would pay for my meal, they will ask for your name and then call the restaurant.

[6] - It seems like it's very common because the person who I talk to when I call always says "I have a lot of similar cases, what is your name so I can call the restaurant", I have done this about 3-4 times, I don't know how this lady doesn't recognize my voice.
