[1] - First Go Here https://www.bookitprogram.com/

[2] - Then top right click “Enroll” and click “I’m a homeschool parent” 

[3] - For the “Enrollment Info” just put anything. But make your name sound like a teacher (you know what I mean lol just don't put “Pimp Daddy” or shit like that)

[4] - Also when entering your email make sure you can access that because that's where the codes will be sent! 

[5] - Next you should be at “Home Info” just make everything on there FAKE and use a burner number. Doesn't really matter lol. 

[6] - MOST IMPORTANT STEP!! MAKE SURE YOU CLICK THE NUMBER 5 FOR THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS!!

[7] - Once you fill all of that garbage out hit next of course.

[8] - Now you should see “Enter Student Info”

[9] - Just fill it out like I did except change around the names! I’d also recommend that you have the age be from 9-12!

[10] - Now when you get here, click YES! Now finish the setup of your account and stuff

[11] - Now log into your new account and you should be greeted with this screen. Enter what I have. 

[12] - NOW once you fill out the reading goal, you should land here! And then click on the “XXXX Homeroom”

[13] - NEXT you want to drag EVERY slider all the way to the right until you get a pop up in your browser asking if you want to reward the student, then click yes!

[14] - Now your all done! If your too lazy to check your email for the code, you can go to the “reward” tab and click the little Paper icon and you should see the email it sent to that “STUDENT” ( wink wink )
