But there where 3 long black hairs going through the chicken and chips we near been sick and for my kids to experience this and im very disappointed, we've been going to KFC for years now, and this to happen is a disgrace. After we brought the KFC back to the store they said they didn't want to do anything about it and said i have to contact KFC on the website, so here i am contacting you and i am disgusted at the moment due to this.
This happened 2 days ago and i'm only getting the chance to contact yours now, Wasted my money on nothing. Again thanks."
