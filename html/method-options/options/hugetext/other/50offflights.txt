"Skip lagging is a travel technique where you save on airfare by booking a ticket through the place you actually want to go and get off there. Sometimes it makes business class cheaper than the economy. 

Skip Lagging Rules: 
IMPORTANT - "There are rules to skip lagging, which simply cannot be broken. If you do, you'll ruin your trip, and perhaps your entire week. It's like a secret club for people who love to save money, so basically everyone on Earth. 
( You Must Not Break These Rules! )"

[1] - Never tell someone you're skipping a flight, especially airlines.
[2] - It only works one way, you can't do it round trip.
[3] - Once you miss a flight, the rest of your reservation is canceled, no exceptions.
[4] - You can't check luggage, because it will carry on without you.
[5] - You must be careful not to abuse every time ( or it can charge back to you, I think ).
