Macros Stardegy:
The hierarchy of analysis importance here goes down in size:
1. Global Macro
2. Country Specific
3. Economic Sector (Materials, Utilities, Consumer Staples)

(Whole asset classes (Stocks, Bonds, Precious Metals), including Crypto, exist closest to #1)

If we want to know where we are going, always start at the highest level and work down. 

If you don't know what's happening in the next highest level (e.g. You think a stock will do well, but you don't know where the economy is going), STOP and go up a level, otherwise the 'beta' of the asset will smack you upside the head with a surprise you didn't see coming.

Takeaway: As you get more specific, you assume all the risks in every preceding level of analysis. 


[Economic outlook entering August]

    - The USA is transitioning from a trending regime of growth  to marginal deflation, this trend is bad for risk assets.
    - Therefore there is a marginal chance there will be further rug-pulls in both crypto and stocks over the coming months due to negative macroeconomic effects.
    - We are out of the 'easy money' phase of the macroeconomic cycle which is a sign negative trends in risk assets should be taken seriously.
    - Caveat: Second order effects may induce the FED to stimulate again, changing the entire macroeconomic landscape, however this may require a 15-20% fall in stock prices.

- Highest expected value asset classes in Q3 = Bonds, Gold, USD (short $$$/USD pairs)
For reference, these are my credentials.

A propriety system used to manage exposure to stocks/bonds/gold over the full business cycle. While I cannot give signals (as no backtest is perfect moving forwards into the future), I will be using this model to guide my portfolio decisions. 

You will all share alongside my performance. Pay attention, class is now in session...
