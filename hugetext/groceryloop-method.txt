Requirements: Aged account at least 1 to 2 weeks old ( working on a method for aged acc )

Tip: For best chance of success please use a previously old account, we are currently working on a method for it to work on brand new accounts

[1] - Create a account at https://www.instacart.com/store

[2] -  Have the account sit for a while (Out of 5, 1 week old accounts, only 1 passed, so I would recommend to wait 2 weeks at least)

[3] - Open support chat at https://www.instacart.com/help/contact/method

[4] - Talk to chat (and be very nice to them, first of all its common sense literally use your brain and social engineering, and if you are rude they will just decline you), tell them that you have been member of instacart for a while now and you received an email stating you can get $50 off your next 2 orders, and mention that the code is invalid.

[5] - Ask if they can help with that, if all goes well, they will manually add the code to your account and you get $50 off the next 2 orders.
