Beats Headphones Method:
---------------------------
Requirements:
- 1 or 2 photos of some headphones (craigslist works for that)
- A receipt (they don't validate)
- *optional* I've never been asked for one, but a serial could come in handy.

What to do:
[1] - Go to beatsbydre.com and go to their support, fill out the form.
[2] - come up with an excuse as to why your headphones aren't working, I generally say that the problem is with the audio, as that means the photo doesn't need to be shopped.
[3] - Wait a day or 2 for a reply ( I know they're slow as fuck. but it's worth it )
[4] - They will ask you for a few details about the headphones and for the receipt and pictures so do that.
[5] - They'll email you back in a few more days saying that they've sent the claim to the warranty claims department and you'll be receiving headphones soon.
[6] - *only if you're from the US or Canada or UK* you will need to box them as well unfortunately.

( Well, all you really have to invest is about $40-$50 and some time. )
[1] - Get Beats Dr. Dre Speaker Serial (Very easy if you go to Best Buy, they don't cover them up)
[2] - Contact Beats and complain that you bought the speaker about 2-3 months ago and it won't turn on, etc
[3] - They will ask if you have PoP, say yes you have the online receipt (Amazon, NewEgg, BestBuy, etc)
[4] - They will give you a label to print out and send it in, you have to pay for the shipping and for the box
[5] - Spoof the weight of the box (I used dry ice) You may not have to spoof the weight but I recommend it
[6] - Send it out with a printed copy of the receipt, shipping with a weight of 5 pounds to there place from my state costs about $30, my ice costs $20
[7] - They will get the box, call you, and say that there was nothing in the box about 5-7 days after you ship it
[8] - You claim that you put it in there and they will offer a replacement because the package was "stolen"
( you could do cheaper beats products such as there tiny headphones which you could not have to spoof the weight at all because it weighs just about nothing. )
