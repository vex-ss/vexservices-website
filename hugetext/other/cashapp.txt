Cashapp Method 1:
------------------------------------
[1] - Download Text Now on the App store or Google Play store
[2] - Create a phone number
[3] - Go on Paxful.com or on the App store/Google Play store
[4] - Create an account
[5] - Buy a Visa/Mastercard Giftcard
[6] - Go on Pax buy bitcoin & buy bitcoin with your card. When buying bitcoin don't be dumb, & try & calculate. Never buy a CC less than $30! Meaning put $40 on that giftcard (fees) & don't forget the reciept.
[7] - Once the bitcoin order is successful go to BingoDumps.com
[8] - Create an account, go to Billing
[9] - Create a Wallet with bitcoin, copy the wallet address
[10] - Go back to Blockchain and add the wallet address under addresses
[11] - Take the bitcoin you bought and send it to that address
[12] - Then go back to bingodumps it should be synced
[13] - Now you want to use bin 604578 & get a debit card
[14] - Now you want to create a new cashapp account with that same Text Now phone number , they are going to want you to link a debit card, use the cardholder info for everything
[15] - Now you have linked the debit card, you first have to click ADD cash to the account, if you directly send the cash, that shit gonna fail. Once that is done, you can now create 
another cashapp with another text now # and sent the money from that cashapp to the other cashapp. Then send money from their to a couple of your friends and then to yourself. 
Buit sadly , you can not send $40 at a time or cashapp will fail the transaction and the cardholder will be alerted
[16] - Congratulations you have cashed out
[17] - If you want also u can take cash out from the debit card, and put it on the cashapp account then get a card with cardholders ssn, you need fullz (fullz = full information) & then you can have a 
phyisical card, meaning you can take that card to real stores
------------------------------------

Cashapp Method 2:
------------------------------------
[1] - Click on profile in the top right on cashapp and scroll down to where it says "referral code" (or referral status)
[2] - Enter the code HHMFVTB
[3] - After you enter the code send $5 to a family member or anyone you trust, and have them send you the $5 back
[4] - Now you should have +$15 in your balance, but if you don't see the referral option you can bypass or loop it (again & again)
[5] - Make a new account with preferably a fullz, then order a free cashapp card
[6] - Then in 7-14 days you will be able to do it as much as you want (loop)
