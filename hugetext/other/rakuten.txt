Rakuten Method
-----------------------------
"Spend $30 and get $30 cashback. Easy way to get some free stuff, If you can't think of things to get you can even get a gift card (search for Raise or Giftcards .com on Rakuten )"

[1] - Click here https://bit.ly/3spTkiU sign up for a new account 
[2] - Make a $30 or more purchase at any store on Rakuten (to be careful and sure that you will get the cash back just make it $30 before taxes, that means you are spending at least $30 + the tax $33.xx etc..) 
[3] - Will Get $30 Cashback after a few days making the items Free. 
[4] - ONE LAST STEP. go to your settings in your Rakuten account and enter your PayPal or mailing address. That way they will send you the money automatically, you don't even have to withdraw it. 
Once it is payable they will send to you on their own. PayPal comes much faster than check so I recommend PayPal WHEN CLICKING ON THE STORE CHECK THE LIST OF EXLUSIONS. NOT ALL ITEMS AT ALL STORES EARN CASHBACK. 
Make sure the items you are buying DO earn cashback so you can get the $30. For example Walmart excludes Apple products etc.. all those are listed on the page under "cash back terms"
