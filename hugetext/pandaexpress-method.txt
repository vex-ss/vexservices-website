[1] - Sign up for the program here (you can use fake info, or real info): https://community.pandaexpress.com/read-with-me

[2] - Click on “Create an Enrollment” once you are logged in

[3] - For organization name, select any local elementary school in your area (or the area of the fake address you plan on using). For organization type, select school. Next, enter a real or fake address (corresponding to the elementary school location in the previous step). For the sponsoring store, choose a local Panda Express location in the same area as the school/address you used.

[4] - Fill out the rest of the form with name, email, phone, etc. You only need access to the email; the rest of the info isn’t that important.

[5] - On the next page, the enrollment nickname can be anything. The number of students will correspond to the number of Free Kids Meal promo codes you will be receiving. I personally chose 25. Material type should be digital materials and enrollment year should be 2021 Calendar Year. I chose 3rd grade as my level, but other grades should work as well.

[6] - On the final page, agree to the terms and confirm the request. In around 1-3 weeks, you should receive an email on whether you were approved or not. If approved, you will receive a spreadsheet file with all of the codes you requested for the Free Kids Meals.

[7] - If you need more Kids Meal codes, simply head over to the website and login. Under Pending Enrollments, click the 3-dot option menu in the top right of the enrollment details and Request a Refill. On the next page, enter the number of codes you’d like to refill (be reasonable).

[8] - Refills should be approved within 1-5 days and you can begin to loop more codes using this single account (no need to make multiple accounts).
